      summary 'Minimal provider that executes a custom command'

      description sq(<<-str)
        This deployment provider executes a single, custom command. This is
        usually a script that is contained in your repository, but it can be
        any command executable in the build environment.

        It is possible to pass arguments to a script deployment like so:

          dpl script -s './scripts/deploy.sh production --verbose'

        Deployment will be marked a failure if the script exits with nonzero
        status.
      str

      opt '--script ./script', 'The script to execute', required: true

      def deploy
        shell script, assert: 'Script failed with status %{status}'
      end
    end
  end
end
